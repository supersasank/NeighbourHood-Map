## Project Requirements / Features

* Display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within chosen neighborhood. Your app displays those locations by default when the page is loaded.
* Implementation a list view of the set of locations.
* Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load. The list view and the markers update accordingly.
* Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked.
* Add functionality to animate a map marker when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.
* Add functionality to open an infoWindow when either a location is selected from the list view or its map marker is selected directly.
